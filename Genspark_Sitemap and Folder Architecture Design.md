## Key Features of the Design:

### üåê **Interactive Sitemap Visualization**
- Complete 3-level hierarchy with visual tree structure
- Color-coded sections for easy navigation
- Expandable/collapsible categories for better organization

### üìÅ **Structured Folder Architecture**
- Maintains your existing core folders with enhanced organization
- Logical subfolder hierarchy for scalability
- Clear separation between content types and user functions

### üîÑ **Navigation Flow Design**
- Intuitive user pathways from homepage to key resources
- Cross-linking recommendations between related sections
- Mobile-responsive navigation structure

### üìã **Professional Naming Conventions**
- Standardized folder naming using Greek terminology
- File naming templates: `TYPE_THEME_YEAR_vX.ext`
- Consistent taxonomy for easy maintenance

## Core Architecture Highlights:

**Main Navigation Areas:**
- **Resource Library** (7 specialized folders)
- **Interactive Tools** (Forum, Search, User Management)
- **Administrative Functions** (Reports, Analytics, Settings)

**Scalability Features:**
- Modular design for future dashboard integration
- Placeholder sections for case management add-ons
- Extensible forum structure with role-based categories

**User Experience Focus:**
- Quick access to frequently used forms and legislation

- Streamlined inspection report workflows

The design follows clean, modular principles with easy-to-read structure that can scale efficiently as your portal grows. Each section is carefully planned to support the daily workflows of social workers across Greece's regional directorates.

Would you like me to save this design to your AI Drive for future reference, or would you prefer any modifications to specific sections of the architecture?
